        <p><strong>Concept: </strong>There's this great little unlockable mini game from the first Warioware GBA title called "Bird and Beans". In this game, you play as a bird that needs to protect itself from a never-ending barrage of falling beansprouts. You do this by ectending your tongue to eat the beans. If you play it enough, you unlock its second iteration. In this minigame, you shoot seeds out of the bird's mouth to break the falling beans before they hit you, or destroy the ground underneath you. I became highly addicted to this game as a kid, but it was very simplistic. I'd like to take the concept of this minigame and add platforming elements to make it more immersive. I'd like the player to be able to jump over gaps in the floor and possibly fall to lower platforms for protection.</p>
        <p><strong>Genre: </strong>2D platformer combined with an endless shooter</p>
        <p><strong>Platform: </strong>Desktop</p>
        <p><strong>Story: </strong>The world has been plagued with an eternal meteor/bean/misc. projectile shower. Survive.</p>
        <p><strong>Graphic style: </strong>Retro. I'm not even remotely passable at art unless its pixel art.</p>
        <p><strong>Sound: </strong>8 bit sound effects. I’d like a looping soundtrack if I can find a suitable free one. I'll need some basic shooting and crashing noises. It would be really cool if I could finally figure out how to use Famitracker to make these sound effects on my own.</p>
        <p><strong>Mechanics: </strong>The player moves left and right to avoid falling objects. They can also jump over chasms left when objects destroy the ground.</p>
        <p><strong>Control: </strong>The keyboard and mouse will be used to control the game. The keyboard will be used to control movement of the character, and clicking the mouse is used to shoot projectiles. This kind of control scheme isn't used for platformers very often but I think it'll make the game translate to destop more smoothly.</p>
        <p><strong>Teaching: </strong>Basic instructions will be available at the title screen.</p>
        <p><strong>Learning: </strong>The game isn’t beatable, the objective is to get the high score.</p>
